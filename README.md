NATURAL LANGUAGE PROCESSING TAKE – AWAY CAT I
Write a python program to tokenize the following paragraph: "A Hare was making fun of the 
Tortoise one day for being so slow. "Do you ever get anywhere?" he asked with a mocking 
laugh. "Yes," replied the Tortoise, "and I get there sooner than you think. I'll run you a race 
and prove it." The Hare was much amused at the idea of running a race with the Tortoise, 
but for the fun of the thing he agreed. So, the Fox, who had consented to act as judge, marked 
the distance and started the runners off." into words and sentence tokens using the NLTK 
module. The program should implement lemmatization and stemming words using the Porter’s 
Stemmer Algorithm and remove the stop words and punctuations
